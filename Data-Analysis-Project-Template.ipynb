Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n",

One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",
